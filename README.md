## Usage

Upon opening the `index.html` file, you will be presented with the Admin Dashboard interface. The sidebar on the left provides navigation links to different sections of the dashboard, such as Dashboard, Customers, Orders, Analytics, Messages, Products, Reports, Settings, and Add Products.

The main content area displays an overview of the total sales, expenses, and income for the last 24 hours, along with progress visualizations. Below, you can find a table showing recent orders with details like product name, product number, payment status, and shipping status.

On the right side, you'll find sections for recent updates, sales analytics (online orders, offline orders, and new customers), and an "Add Product" button.

The top bar includes a menu button to toggle the sidebar, a theme toggler to switch between light and dark modes, and a profile section displaying the logged-in user's information.

## Customization

You can customize various aspects of the Admin Dashboard to fit your specific needs:

1. Replace the placeholder data with your actual data for orders, updates, and analytics.
2. Modify the CSS styles in the `style.css` file to change the appearance, colors, and layout of the components.
3. Enhance the functionality by adding additional features or integrating with your backend systems.
